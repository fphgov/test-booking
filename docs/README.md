# Documentation

User guide for backend application developed by the Municipality of Budapest for the management of COVID rapid testing. This guide is intended to provide exhaustive information about the requirements, installing, configuration and operation of the application. However, some missing pieces of information are possible. The guide comprises our developer's recommendations and preferences, but they are often optional.

This guide is not meant to replace DevOps skills, but it does provide a viable form of operation, also we leave the project open for futher development. The most secure solutions are not always covered, but we highly recommend to use security solutions such as `fail2ban`,`ufw`, `ModSecurity` or other WAF.
